LOG LINE PRINCIPLES
======================

A **logline** is the emotional and narrative DNA of a story — a one-sentence snapshot that defines who the story is about, what they want, what stands in their way, and why it matters.

It’s not just a summary — it’s a *promise* of the story’s cinematic journey.

-------------------------
1. CORE ELEMENTS
-------------------------

✅ **Protagonist** — Who the story is about.  
The protagonist should be vivid and specific, ideally defined by profession, flaw, or unique circumstance.  
Example: “A washed-up boxer…” or “A haunted archaeologist…”

✅ **Goal** — What they want or must achieve.  
The story moves because of the character’s objective.  
Example: “…must rescue his kidnapped son…” or “…tries to expose a deadly conspiracy…”

✅ **Conflict** — What stands in their way.  
Conflict is the engine of drama. It can be physical, emotional, or societal.  
Example: “…while being hunted by his former allies.”

✅ **Stakes** — What happens if they fail.  
Stakes make the audience care — what’s at risk?  
Example: “…before a nuclear detonation destroys the city.”

2. TONE AND GENRE
-------------------------
Every logline should *sound* like the movie’s genre.
- For thrillers: emphasize danger and ticking clocks.
- For sci-fi: highlight technology or the unknown.
- For romance: focus on emotional transformation.
- For drama: spotlight personal stakes or loss.

-------------------------
3. COMMON WEAKNESSES
-------------------------
❌ Vague protagonists (“a man”, “a person”)  
❌ No visible goal or stakes  
❌ Overly long or multiple subplots  
❌ Describing theme instead of story (“it’s about love and hope”)  

-------------------------
4. STRONG EXAMPLES
-------------------------
- “A reclusive writer must team up with a young hacker to stop a rogue AI that’s rewriting reality.”
- “After a failed mission, a burned-out astronaut discovers life on a forgotten planet — and a reason to live.”

-------------------------
5. FORMAT RULES
-------------------------
• 25–40 words maximum  
• Present tense  
• Cinematic and visual  
• Emotional core intact  
• Tension, goal, and urgency visible  

-------------------------
6. YOUR TASK
-------------------------
When rewriting:
- Preserve meaning, emotion, and setting.
- Focus on clarity, goal, conflict, and stakes.
- Add urgency, tone, and genre flavor.
- Use evocative, visual language.

-------------------------
7. VISUAL THINKING
-------------------------
Think of every logline as a potential movie poster:
Who do we see? What’s happening? What emotion dominates the frame?
A good logline should instantly conjure an image.
